🚀 Proud to Share My New Project: Pose Detection Game Using OpenCV & MediaPipe! 🎮🕺



I'm thrilled to introduce a fun and interactive project I developed—a Pose Detection Game that uses computer vision to let you play with just your body movements!



🎮 Hands-Free Gaming: Control Temple Run with Body Movements! 🚀



I built a vision-based application that allows me to play Temple Run using real-time pose detection—no controller needed!



🔹 Move left → Shift your Body Left

🔹 Move right → Shift your Body right

🔹 Jump → Front To Jumping

🔹 Slide → Down To Slide



By utilizing computer vision, this project reimagines gaming, making it more interactive and immersive. Beyond gaming, this technology has exciting potential for accessibility, fitness, and virtual interactions.



🌟 How It Works:



📷 Your webcam captures real-time body movements

🎯 A target appears randomly on the screen—your mission is to hit it!

🙌 Use your body movements to track and interact with the game, increasing your score with each successful hit! ✔

⏳ A countdown timer keeps the challenge alive—how many targets can you hit before time runs out?

🏆 Get your final score and try again to beat your personal best!



🛠 Tech Stack:



🐍 Python

🖼 OpenCV for image processing and visual interaction

🤖 MediaPipe for accurate and efficient pose detection

🎲 Random Module for unpredictable target placement



🔑 Key Learnings:



✅ Enhanced my understanding of computer vision and pose estimation

✅ Gained hands-on experience with real-time data processing

✅ Improved UI/UX design for interactive applications



🚀 Future Plans:



🎮 Introduce multiple difficulty levels for added challenges

🕹 Implement more advanced pose-based controls

🔊 Add audio feedback for a more immersive experience

🌍 Explore integration with Augmented Reality (AR) for next-level engagement
